# OSINT-Global-Offensive

## Introduction

OSINT-Global-Offensive is an advanced open-source intelligence (OSINT) framework designed to streamline and automate the
process of gathering, analyzing, and processing publicly available information. Built for cybersecurity professionals,
ethical hackers, and investigative researchers, this project leverages various data sources to provide actionable
intelligence.

## Key Features

- **Automated Data Collection** – Extract and process data from multiple sources, including social media, websites, and
  public databases.
- **Modular Architecture** – Easily extend functionality with new data sources and processing modules.
- **Efficient Search & Filtering** – Query and filter results to extract relevant insights.
- **Data Normalization** – Standardizes extracted data for better analysis and correlation.
- **Extensive API Support** – Integrates with third-party services and APIs for enriched intelligence gathering.
- **Scalability** – Built with Docker to ensure easy deployment and scalability.
- **Enhanced Security** – Leverages HashiCorp Vault for secure storage of secrets and credentials.
- **Custom Git Modules** – Implements `not_gitmodules` to manage dependencies more effectively.

## Use Cases

- **Cybersecurity Investigations** – Identify threats, track malicious actors, and uncover security vulnerabilities.
- **Threat Intelligence** – Monitor potential risks and analyze digital footprints.
- **Law Enforcement & Forensics** – Support investigations by uncovering publicly available evidence.
- **Journalistic Research** – Gather and verify information for investigative journalism.
- **Competitive Intelligence** – Analyze market trends and monitor competitors.
