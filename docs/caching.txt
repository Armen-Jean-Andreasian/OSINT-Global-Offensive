Standalone models have: SINGLE_ITEM_CACHE_KEY
One to many relation models have:  SINGLE_ITEM_CACHE_KEY, SINGLE_ITEMS_CACHE_KEY

---

The models of the project are:

- UserModel
- LoggerModel | one user and many ObtainedDataModel
- ObtainedDataModel | one LoggerModel


So accordingly:

- UserCache | cache single user
- LoggerModel | cache single logger by logger_id, cache multiple loggers by user_id
- ObtainedDataModel | cache multiple obtained_data_models by logger_id (ObtainedDataModel doesn't have id)
