## Architectural Principles
- **Lightweight and Optimized** – Adheres to `LOB` and `YAGNI` principles, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
- **Service-Oriented Design** – CRUD operations are handled at the model level, reducing reliance on controllers.
- **Controllerless Flow** – Views handle data presentation, while models manage CRUD operations.
- **Custom Logging System** – Implements a structured logging mechanism for audit trails and debugging.
